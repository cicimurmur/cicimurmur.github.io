    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ </p>
    <h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>
            Passing cars,
            <br>When you can't see,
            <br>May get you,
            <br>A glimpse,
            <br>Of eternity.
        </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
    <h3>June 2, 2012</h3>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <blockquote>
            <ol type="circle">
                <li>cellphone, </li>
                <li>iPod, </li>
                <li>digital camera, </li>
                <li>protein bar</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>
        As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
